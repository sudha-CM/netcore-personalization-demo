# Netcore Personalization Demo (Streamlit)

A tiny, fast demo storefront that shows how Netcore could personalize a user’s channel experience in real time:

- 3 categories (Dresses, Tops, Bottoms) with product grids
- “Quick View” overlay (works on any Streamlit version via fallback)
- Right-side **Prediction Widget** (preferred category, style, discount affinity)
- Collapsible **Store Analytics** (dwell time, scroll %, location/weather placeholders)
- **Personalized Email** preview with brand logo + product cards (downloadable HTML)
